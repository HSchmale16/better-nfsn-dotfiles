# Better NFSN Environment
This is my attempt to create a better minimum environment for ssh with
[nearlyfreespeech.net][1]. It contains various shell aliases and fixes some
defaults to be more inline with a standard Linux environment.

* Making `vi` equivalent to `vim`
* A colored shell prompt to remind you that this is a production
  environment.
* Some common defaults for VIM.
    * Tabs are spaces.
    * All are 4 spaces.
